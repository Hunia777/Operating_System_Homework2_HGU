BEFORE RUNNING
1. Execute "make clean"
2. Execute "make" 
3. If target_results and solution_results are existed, Delete them(It is important).

FOR RUNNING
1. ENTER Command "./pctest -i /home/s21600786/OShw2/TESTS -t 10 solution target"
2. If you do not enter like this, PCTEST cannot run.

FOR TESTING
1. If you check the error case, you can change error type in target.c
2. FOR making error, you should set #define ERRORMODE 1, and then make another options
3. If you do not check ERRORMODE, it will be make unexpected errors.

Thank you :)
